Line following robot, using an Arduino Uno, 2 DC motors, and a five headed IR sensor array.

Throughout this project, I solved multiple technical challenges, improved sensor stability, optimized motor control, and enhanced my Arduino programming skills.
I also empowered it with a sense of historical memory, allowing the system to learn from its previous experiences.
